# Market Buzz Kids — Project Context

A daily kid-friendly stock market digest for ages 10–14 and their parents. Delivered as a 7 AM EST email teaser to the parent, linking to a full interactive web digest the kid plays through in ~3 minutes a day. Real investing principles taught through news, games, streaks, and progressive ranks. Free product with future-hedged monetization (privacy policy §3).

**5+2 edition system:** Tuesday–Saturday digests follow the standard format (previous trading day recap). Sunday is **The Weekly Wrap** (full-week recap + Weekly Challenge card). Monday and the day after any NYSE market holiday is **The Week Ahead** (forward-looking preview of upcoming earnings + economic data). See `src/calendar.js` for the resolver.

- **Repo:** https://github.com/SunnyD27/market-buzz-kids (public, `main`)
- **Local:** `~/market-buzz-kids`
- **Production:** https://market-buzz-kids-production.up.railway.app
- **Deploy:** Railway (Dockerfile, auto-deploys on push to `main`)
- **Port:** 3199 locally (3101 is the a3l-books project)

> **⚠️ This is the product version.** The original personal digest for Sunny lives at `~/market-buzz` with its own CONTEXT.md and repo (`SunnyD27/market-buzz`). They are completely separate projects. Do NOT read or reference `~/market-buzz/CONTEXT.md` when working on this project — it describes an older, simpler architecture (VOO scoreboard, no games, no database, no signup).

```

Single Node.js process. `node-cron` triggers `generateDigest()` at 7:00 AM `America/New_York`. The function is **idempotent** — it checks `daily_digests` in Postgres first; if today's row exists, it just writes the cached content to disk (~0.35s, zero API calls) and returns. Both the boot-time bootstrap AND the 7 AM cron call `generateDigest()`. First one to create the row wins; the other is a no-op.

After generation, `sendDailyTeasers()` emails all active subscribers via Resend.

## Routes

| Route | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /` | none | Landing page (`public/landing.html`). Parent-facing signup + CTA to `/sample`. |
| `GET /digest` | none | Today's digest (kid-facing, PWA `start_url`). Read path: disk → DB → sample fallback. |
| `GET /sample` | none | Static evergreen sample digest (`public/data/sample-digest.json`). Never auto-regenerates. |
| `GET /privacy` | none | COPPA-compliant privacy policy. |
| `GET /parent/delete-data` | none | Parent data deletion request form. |
| `POST /api/signup` | none | Creates user row, sends verification email. |
| `GET /api/verify` | token in query | Email verification → triggers consent email to parent. |
| `GET /api/consent` | token in query | Parental consent → activates account, sends welcome email. |
| `POST /api/delete-data` | email in body | Soft-delete user data, sends deletion acknowledgment email. |
| `POST /api/cron/send-digest` | `X-Cron-Secret` header | External trigger for daily teaser fan-out. |
| `GET /generate?key=<ADMIN_KEY>` | query param | Manually triggers `generateDigest()`. |
| `GET /api/health` | none | DB connectivity check. |

---

## File map

### Backend (`src/`)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `server.js` | Express app. Routes, signup/consent flow, cron, boot bootstrap, daily-teaser fan-out. `dotenv` loaded with `override:true` (macOS launchd gotcha). |
| `generate.js` | **Idempotent** digest generator. Checks `daily_digests` DB first; if today's row exists, writes to disk and returns. Otherwise: full pipeline → INSERT → disk. |
| `data.js` | FMP `/stable/` API client. `fetchMarketData`, `fetchNews`, `fetchMovers`, `fetchTopMover`, `fetchQuotes`. All ticker fetches use **per-ticker fan-out** (FMP free tier doesn't support multi-ticker batch). Tolerates `changePercentage` ↔ `changesPercentage` field rename. |
| `ai.js` | Claude API calls. Three exports: `generateContent` (main digest with web_search), `reframeBullBear` (bull-bear narrative), `reframeTimeMachine` (time-machine framing). `generateContent` routes between three internal prompt builders (`buildStandardPrompt`, `buildWeeklyWrapPrompt`, `buildWeekAheadPrompt`) based on `opts.edition.editionType` from calendar.js. **Lazy client init** (deferred `new Anthropic()` so dotenv has run). Includes `PROFANITY_RULE` in all prompts + `scrubProfanity()` regex pass on all output. |
| `calendar.js` | Edition type resolver. NYSE holiday calendar, day-of-week detection, `DATE_OVERRIDE` env-var support for testing. Exports `getEditionType()`, `getEditionDate()`, `isMarketHoliday()`, `getLastTradingDay()`, `getHolidayName()`, plus `MARKET_HOLIDAYS` for 2026–2027. |
| `games.js` | Daily Challenge orchestrator. Deterministic 8-day rotation picker, per-game hydrators, falls back to canned content on AI/FMP failure. Two AI calls max per day (bull-bear + time-machine reframers, in parallel). |
| `template.js` | Builds digest HTML. Pure function — same input always produces same output. Renders Daily Challenge picker, handles `isSample` flag (gold SAMPLE banner + chip), renders `editionLabel` subtitle for Weekly Wrap / Week Ahead editions, renders Weekly Challenge card when `weeklyChallenge` is present (Sunday-only). |
| `db.js` | pg Pool, **lazy-initialized** (same dotenv timing pattern). Exports `pool` (Proxy), `query`, `getClient`, `healthCheck`. |
| `digest-store.js` | `todayNY()`, `getDigestForDate()`, `getTodaysDigest()`, `saveDigest()`. The `saveDigest` helper is the immutability lock — `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` ensures today's row can never be overwritten. |
| `storage.js` | Postgres-backed user/token/deletion helpers. Async throughout. Same API surface as the Phase 5 in-memory version. |
| `content-history.js` | Word-of-Day + Did-You-Know rotation guard. Generic `getRecent(kind)` / `record(kind)` backed by `state/content-history.json`. 30-day window. |
| `emails.js` | Email renderers (pure) + `sendEmail` (Resend SDK). Five types: verify, consent, welcome, deletion-ack, daily teaser. Stub-mode fallback if `RESEND_API_KEY` is missing. |
| `companies.js` | 75-company curated kid-recognizable list with `lookupCompany(ticker)` helper. |
| `schema.sql` | Neon DDL. Apply with `scripts/run-schema.js`. Idempotent (uses `IF NOT EXISTS`). |

### Frontend (`public/`)

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `landing.html` / `.css` / `.js` | Landing + signup. CTA links to `/sample`, not `/digest`. |
| `privacy.html` | COPPA-compliant privacy policy. §3 hedged for future sponsored content (30-day notice). |
| `parent-delete-data.html` | Data deletion request UI. |
| `index.html` | Generated daily digest (**gitignored** — rebuilt from DB on each boot). |
| `digest-data.json` | JSON payload consumed by template (**gitignored** — same lifecycle). |
| `engagement.js` / `engagement.css` | XP/rank/streak/shield engine. Fully client-side localStorage. |
| `games-preview.html` | Standalone game test harness. |
| `games/*.js` | 5 game modules (quiz is inline in the template). |
| `games/daily-challenge.js` | Picker UI + 8-day rotation. **Rotation logic is duplicated in `src/games.js` — keep both in sync.** |
| `data/company-models.json` | 37 companies for Match + Price-is-Right. |
| `data/time-machine-prices.json` | 7 verified Time Machine scenarios. |
| `data/historical-charts.json` | 10 verified Bull-or-Bear scenarios. |
| `data/sample-digest.json` | Static curated sample. Served by `/sample`. Edit manually to refresh. |
| `manifest.webmanifest` | PWA manifest, `start_url: /digest`. |
| `sw.js` / `pwa.js` | Service worker + add-to-homescreen UX. Push notification placeholder in `pwa.js` (Phase 6.3 not done). |

### Scripts (`scripts/`)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `run-schema.js` | Apply `src/schema.sql` to Neon. Idempotent. |
| `inspect-db.js` | Print recent rows across all tables. |
| `test-games.js` | Hydrate daily-challenge games standalone. Flags: `--ai`, `--fmp`, `--date YYYY-MM-DD`. |

### Ephemeral state (gitignored)

- `state/content-history.json` — word/fact rotation history. **Ephemeral on Railway** — wiped on container restart. Acceptable for MVP; should move to Postgres before heavy deploy frequency.

---

## Environment variables

### Local (`.env`, gitignored)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:

| Var | Required for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | All DB-backed routes | Neon connection string with `?sslmode=require` |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Real email sending | Falls back to console-log stub if missing |
| `FROM_EMAIL` | Resend `from` field | Default `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing |
| `CRON_SECRET` | `POST /api/cron/send-digest` | Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Absolute URLs in emails | Local: `http://localhost:3199`. Prod: the Railway URL. |
| `FMP_API_KEY` | `generateDigest()` | Free tier 250 req/day is fine |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `generateDigest()` | Web search is billable (~$10/1,000 searches) |
| `ADMIN_KEY` | `GET /generate?key=…` | Any URL-safe random string (no `#`, `&`, `+`, `%`, spaces) |
| `PORT` | Local override | 3199 locally. Railway auto-injects in prod. |

### Production (Railway dashboard)

Same set minus `PORT` (auto-injected) and `NODE_ENV` (set in Dockerfile).

**Critical:** `APP_BASE_URL` must be the full `https://` URL of the deployment (no trailing slash), or outgoing emails will link to `localhost`.

---

## How a daily digest is generated

`src/generate.js#generateDigest()` — the full pipeline:

### Step 0 — Idempotency check (`src/digest-store.js`)

Check `daily_digests` table for today's date (NY timezone). If a row exists, write its content to disk and return immediately. Zero API calls, ~0.35s. This is why redeploys never change today's content.

### Step 0.5 — Edition detection (`src/calendar.js`)

Only runs when Step 0 misses (today's row doesn't exist yet). `getEditionType()` resolves the day-of-week + NYSE holiday calendar to one of three edition types — `standard`, `weekly-wrap`, or `week-ahead` — and threads that through to the AI prompt builder. The edition is baked into the row that Step 5 inserts, so once today's digest is locked in, its edition stays locked too.

### Step 1 — Fetch raw market data (`src/data.js`)

Concurrent calls to `https://financialmodelingprep.com/stable/...`:

| Function | Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `fetchMarketData` | `/quote?symbol=^GSPC` (+ `^IXIC`, `^DJI`) | Price, change, %change for 3 index scoreboard cards. Per-ticker fan-out. |
| `fetchNews` | `/general-news`, `/stock-news?tickers=...`, `/fmp-articles` | Pooled headlines from 5 sources, deduped, filtered (no penny stocks, cannabis, short titles). Up to 15. |
| `fetchMovers` | `/biggest-gainers`, `/biggest-losers` | Top 3 each, price > $5. |
| `fetchTopMover` | `/quote?symbol=<ticker>` for each of 75 curated companies | Largest absolute % mover from the kid-recognizable list. Per-ticker fan-out. |

All requests go through `fmpFetch` helper which surfaces error bodies in logs.

### Step 2 — Generate content (`src/ai.js#generateContent`)

One call to Anthropic:

- **Model:** `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- **max_tokens:** 8000
- **tools:** `[{ type: "web_search_20250305", name: "web_search" }]`
- **Prompt:** STEP 1 tells Claude to web-search for today's top business news. Voice/tone rules enforce kid-friendly language. Story selection rules filter to front-page-worthy stories only. PROFANITY_RULE sets content guardrails. "Avoid these recent words/facts" list from content-history prevents repeats.

Response parsing: concatenate `text` blocks, strip markdown fences + `<cite>` tags, parse JSON (with fallback extraction of largest `{...}` span). Run `scrubProfanity()` on all output.

**Claude returns this JSON schema:**

```json
{
  "date": "Wednesday, May 20, 2026",
  "tradingDay": "yesterday" | "this week" | "last Friday",
  "editionType": "standard" | "weekly-wrap" | "week-ahead",   // Phase 6.8 — present on all editions
  "editionLabel": "The Weekly Wrap 📋" | "The Week Ahead 🔮",  // present on non-standard editions
  "marketVibe": "green" | "red" | "mixed",
  "vibeEmoji": "🚀",
  "vibeSummary": "One-sentence summary",
  "bigPicture": "3-4 sentence world-news briefing",
  "scoreboard": {
    "sp500":  { "price", "change", "direction": "up"|"down", "vibe" },
    "nasdaq": { ... },
    "dow":    { ... }
  },
  "topMover": {
    "name", "ticker", "price", "change", "direction", "vibe", "reason",
    "principle": 1-11
  },
  "stories": [ 2-3 items: { "badge", "badgeLabel", "title", "body", "whyItMatters", "principle": 1-11 } ],
  "didYouKnow": { "fact", "category", "principle": 1-11, "principleConnection" },
  "quiz": { "question", "options": [4], "correctIndex", "explanation", "principle": 1-11 },
  "wordOfDay": { "word", "type", "context", "definition", "principle": 1-11 },
  "weeklyChallenge": { "headline", "body", "principle": 1-11 }   // Sunday weekly-wrap ONLY
}
```

**Edition variants:**

| editionType | Days | stories count | Story badges | Special fields |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `standard` | Tue–Sat (normal weekdays) | 3 (sometimes 2) | mixed | — |
| `weekly-wrap` | Sun | exactly 2 | `WEEK'S BIGGEST`, `ALSO THIS WEEK` | `weeklyChallenge` |
| `week-ahead` | Mon, post-holiday | exactly 2 | `WATCH THIS WEEK`, `ALSO COMING UP` | — |

Every content block carries a `principle` field (1-11) tying it to one of the 11 core investing principles:

1. Pay yourself first — save before you spend
2. Make your money work for you — compound growth is a superpower
3. Spend less than you earn — wealth is the gap
4. Understand what you own — invest in what you know
5. Don't put all your eggs in one basket — diversify
6. Be patient — think in years, not days
7. Control your emotions — don't follow the crowd
8. Think like an owner, not a gambler — stocks are real businesses
9. Stay consistent — regular investing beats perfect timing
10. Know the difference between price and value — expensive isn't always valuable
11. Make money while you sleep — own assets, not just stuff

### Step 3 — Hydrate daily games (`src/games.js`)

Deterministic rotation picks 3 games from the pool of 6. For bull-bear and time-machine days, parallel AI reframer calls add narrative context. Falls back to canned text on any failure. Game data is embedded into the digest JSON as `dataBundle`.

### Step 4 — Build HTML (`src/template.js#buildHTML`)

Pure function. Destructures the JSON, applies `escapeHTML` to all user-facing strings, returns complete `<!DOCTYPE html>`. Sections in order:

```
Header (gradient logo, date, tagline, Investor Profile bar)
  ↓
🏆 Market Scoreboard (3 index cards + gold Today's Mover card)
  ↓
Vibe Bar (green/red/mixed indicator + "Why [Company] moved" callout)
  ↓
🌎 The Big Picture (blue-gradient world-news briefing)
  ↓
🔥 Today's Big Stories (2-3 cards, each with "Why it matters" + principle tag)
  ↓
🎮 Daily Challenge (3-card game picker — quiz + 2 rotating games)
  ↓
💡 Did You Know (fact + principle connection)
  ↓
📖 Word of the Day (yellow card)
  ↓
Footer
```

Self-contained: all CSS inline, Google Fonts (`Fredoka` + `Space Mono`), interactive quiz + games via inline scripts. Mobile-first with 600px media query. Apple PWA meta tags for iPad home-screen.

### Step 5 — Persist + serve

`saveDigest()` inserts into `daily_digests` with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. Writes `public/index.html` and `public/digest-data.json` to disk.

`/digest` read path: disk file → DB row (re-render + warm disk) → `/sample` fallback. Kids never see a "brewing" placeholder.

---

## The engagement system

Fully client-side (localStorage). No server-side identity yet.

- **XP** — earned from quiz answers and game participation (25 XP correct, 15 XP participation)
- **Ranks** — Stock Scout → Trading Cadet → Market Analyst → ... (progressive thresholds)
- **Streaks** — consecutive days of engagement, displayed with 🔥
- **Shields** — protect streaks from breaking (earned at milestones)
- **Perfect Day** — bonus for completing all 3 daily games

Kids who clear browser data or switch devices start fresh. Moving to server-side requires identity wiring (user slugs), which also unlocks parent dashboard, push targeting, cross-device sync, and leaderboards.

---

## Email pipeline

Five email types, all via Resend (`src/emails.js`):

| Email | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Verification | `POST /api/signup` | Confirms parent email is real |
| Consent | `GET /api/verify` (after click) | COPPA parental consent request |
| Welcome | `GET /api/consent` (after click) | Account activated, what to expect |
| Daily teaser | 7 AM cron or `POST /api/cron/send-digest` | Preview of today's digest + link |
| Deletion ack | `POST /api/delete-data` | Confirms data removal |

Stub-mode fallback: if `RESEND_API_KEY` is missing, emails log to console instead of sending. Useful for local development.

---

## Local development

```bash
cd ~/market-buzz-kids
PORT=3199 npm start
```

```bash
# Kill stale server
lsof -ti tcp:3199 | xargs kill

# Apply schema to Neon (idempotent)
node scripts/run-schema.js

# Inspect DB state
node scripts/inspect-db.js

# Test game hydration (no full pipeline)
node scripts/test-games.js              # dry
node scripts/test-games.js --ai --fmp   # live

# Manual digest generation
node src/generate.js

# Regenerate (requires deleting today's immutable row first)
node -e "import('./src/db.js').then(({query}) => query(\"DELETE FROM daily_digests WHERE digest_date = CURRENT_DATE\")).then(()=>process.exit(0))"
node src/generate.js
```

---

## Key design decisions & gotchas

### FMP: /stable endpoints only

FMP deprecated `/api/v3/` and `/api/v4/` for subscriptions after Aug 31, 2025. This project uses `/stable/` exclusively. Pasting code from older FMP docs will fail with `"Legacy Endpoint"` errors.

Multi-ticker batch (`/stable/quote?symbol=A,B,C`) returns `[]` on the free tier. All ticker fetches use per-ticker fan-out in parallel.

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `/api/v3/quote/AAPL` | `/stable/quote?symbol=AAPL` |
| `/api/v3/stock_news?tickers=...` | `/stable/stock-news?tickers=...` |
| `/api/v4/general_news` | `/stable/general-news` |
| `/api/v3/stock_market/gainers` | `/stable/biggest-gainers` |
| `/api/v3/stock_market/losers` | `/stable/biggest-losers` |

### Immutable daily digest

`daily_digests` table uses `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` keyed on `digest_date`. Once today's row exists, it cannot be overwritten without an explicit `DELETE`. This guarantees every visitor sees identical content all day, even through redeploys.

To force a regeneration: delete the row, then run `node src/generate.js`.

### Lazy client initialization

Both `src/ai.js` (Anthropic client) and `src/db.js` (pg Pool) defer initialization until first use. This is because macOS launchd sometimes sets `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""` system-wide, shadowing `.env` values. `dotenv.config({ override: true })` at every entry point + lazy init solves this.

**Any new module that reads env vars at import time will break on macOS.** Always defer.

### Web search citation tags

Claude with `web_search_20250305` sometimes leaks `<cite index="...">...</cite>` tags into JSON values. The parser in `ai.js#parseDigestJSON` strips these before `JSON.parse`. If new tag patterns appear (`<sup>`, `[1]`, etc.), add another regex.

### Kid-safe content: two layers

1. `PROFANITY_RULE` in every Claude prompt — tells the model what to avoid
2. `scrubProfanity()` regex pass over all Claude output — whole-word replacements as a safety net

Both layers must be present in any new prompt template.

### Ephemeral filesystem on Railway

Container restarts wipe disk. `public/index.html` and `digest-data.json` are rebuilt from the DB row on boot. `state/content-history.json` (word/fact rotation) is also wiped — Claude picks reasonable variety on fresh starts, but repeated deploys can cause short-term repeats.

### `/digest` is publicly accessible

No auth gate, by design. Signup is for 7 AM email delivery, not access control. Anyone with the URL can read today's content (good for sharing + SEO). Soft-gate / hard-gate deferred until identity wiring is built.

### Game rotation is duplicated

`public/games/daily-challenge.js` (client) and `src/games.js` (server) both contain the 8-day rotation logic. **Keep them in sync.** The server picks games for content hydration; the client picks for the UI picker.

---

## How to make common changes

| Want to… | Edit |
|---|---|
| Change cron time | `src/server.js` — the `cron.schedule('0 7 * * *', ...)` call |
| Change scoreboard symbols | `src/data.js#fetchMarketData` → `src/ai.js` JSON schema → `src/template.js` scorecard calls |
| Add/remove a news source | `src/data.js#fetchNews` — the `Promise.all` block |
| Tighten/loosen news filter | `src/data.js#fetchNews` — `skipTerms` array + `title.length` guard |
| Change Claude's voice or story rules | `src/ai.js` — the three prompt builders. Each edition (standard, weekly-wrap, week-ahead) has its own VOICE & TONE + STORY SELECTION sections. |
| Change edition logic for weekends/holidays | `src/calendar.js` — the `MARKET_HOLIDAYS` map and `getEditionType()` switch |
| Add a market holiday | `src/calendar.js` — add the date string to that year's array in `MARKET_HOLIDAYS` AND add the display name to `HOLIDAY_NAMES` |
| Tweak Weekly Wrap or Week Ahead prompt | `src/ai.js#buildWeeklyWrapPrompt` or `buildWeekAheadPrompt`. The standard prompt is in `buildStandardPrompt`. |
| Test edition logic on a specific date | `DATE_OVERRIDE=YYYY-MM-DD node src/generate.js`. Delete the test row after with `DELETE FROM daily_digests WHERE digest_date = 'YYYY-MM-DD'` |
| Add a new digest section | 3 places: JSON schema in `src/ai.js`, destructure + render in `src/template.js`, CSS in `template.js` `<style>` block |
| Change page look (colors, fonts, layout) | `src/template.js` `<style>` block. All CSS is inline. |
| Add a curated company | `src/companies.js` — the list + `lookupCompany()` |
| Add a new server route | `src/server.js` — follow the `/generate` or `/health` pattern |
| Disable web search | `src/ai.js` — remove `tools: [...]` from `messages.create` call |
| Change the model | `src/ai.js` — the `model:` field. Re-verify citation stripping afterward. |
| Add game scenarios | `public/data/historical-charts.json` (bull-bear), `public/data/time-machine-prices.json` (time-machine), `public/data/company-models.json` (match + price-is-right) |
| Refresh the sample digest | Edit `public/data/sample-digest.json` manually and commit |

## Known limitations & things not yet done

### Not yet built

- **Push notifications (Phase 6.3)** — VAPID key placeholder in `pwa.js`. Email-only MVP works fine.
- **Server-side engagement** — XP/streaks/ranks are localStorage only. No cross-device sync, no parent dashboard, no leaderboards. Requires identity wiring (user slugs in URL).
- **Engagement persistence** — hybrid PostHog (web analytics) + custom `/api/track` endpoint writing to the `engagement` table in Neon. Table placeholder exists in `schema.sql`. Needed before parent dashboard.
- **Anti-spam on signup** — no rate limiting or captcha on `/api/signup` or `/api/delete-data`. Add Cloudflare Turnstile or rate-limit before scaling.
- **Custom domain** — currently on `railway.app` subdomain. Need a branded domain before public launch.

### Known warts

- **`/generate` admin endpoint times out.** Takes ~60s, hits Railway's 30s proxy timeout. Browser sees `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` but server completes. Fix: refactor to 202 + fire-async.
- **`ADMIN_KEY` unset = open endpoint.** `undefined !== undefined` evaluates to `false`, so the guard passes. Always set `ADMIN_KEY` in production.
- **No retries.** If FMP or Anthropic is down at 7 AM, the digest skips. Add retry logic (7:00, 7:15, 7:30) before scaling.
- **Game datasets are small.** 10 bull-bear + 7 time-machine + 37 company-models scenarios. Kids on 2-week streaks see repeats. Expand pools before growth push.
- **Content rotation ephemeral.** `state/content-history.json` resets on Railway restart. Move to Postgres when deploy frequency increases.
- **`/health` lastGenerated is in-memory.** Resets on restart. Cosmetic — digest file is still served.

## Future roadmap (post-Phase 6)

- **User slugs + digest gating** — permanent slug per user, `/digest/k/:slug`, no tokens/cookies
- **Engagement persistence** — PostHog + `/api/track` + Neon `engagement` table
- **Parent dashboard** — weekly email with engagement stats
- **Expanded game datasets** — 30+ bull-bear, 20+ time-machine scenarios
- **Content-history to Postgres** — survive Railway restarts
- **Per-user content rotation** — requires identity wiring
- **Premium tier** — personalized portfolio, paper trading, ad-free deep dives ($5-8/month)
- **Referral program** — badge/reward unlocks for sharing
- **School partnerships** — curriculum supplement (26 states mandate financial literacy)
